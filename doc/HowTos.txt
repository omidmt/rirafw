JOBS

How to add a new delayed job task for background processing:
1- Create a sub-class of Task in lib/tasks folder
    It must have a perform method that is called in background
    initialize method can be ignored, so in next step call it without any param
2- Wherever in your controller that you want call Job.enqueue and pass parameters, the main one is :task => 'instance of created class in previous step'
3- Add the new task class in DJ initializer
    config/initializers/dj_class_loader.rb > require 'welcome_mail_task'

----------------------------

How clear delayed_job queue:
rake jobs:clear

if you want to remove the jobs from RIRA job gui, you can use rails console and Job model
to select what you want and destroy it

----------------------------

How start delayed_job for development
rake jobs:work
QUEUES=general,mailQ,tariffDQ rake jobs:work

Production
RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job --queues=general,mailQ,tariffDQ -n 3 start

Queue names:
GENERAL_QUEUE               default queue name
MAIL_DELIVERY_QUEUE         sending emails
TARIFF_DISTRIBUTE_QUEUE     distributing tariffs
#TARIFF_ACTIVATE_QUEUE      activating queue (supposed to be merged with previous one as the tasks depend on each other)

Can use { -n 2 } to spawn 2 process
